always use snake_case for variables and functions. if its a class then use CapitalCase i.e. (class FooBar)

always try to define types and return type for functions. and ensure asserts to ensure the variable exists.

if a variable is defined in body of a file (so not in a function etc) then assume its a constant and use all capitals, seperated by _ i.e. (DATA_PATH)
