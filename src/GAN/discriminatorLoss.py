Will check if watermark is maintained after NST.
Takes in pre-NST and post-NST images and compares them.

5. Discriminator Loss (What the Discriminator Learns)
Attempts to recognize if watermark is maintained after NST by comparing watermarked image pre-NST and post-NST.

âœ” Correct!
ðŸ”¹ The discriminator is trained to detect if an image has a watermark.
ðŸ”¹ It compares watermarked images before and after NST.

Equation:

L_D = -log(D(I_s)) - log(1 - D(I_w))

Where:

D(I_s) = Discriminatorâ€™s confidence that a pre-NST image has a watermark.
D(I_w) = Discriminatorâ€™s confidence that a post-NST image has a watermark.

âœ” If D(I_w) is close to 1, NST didn't remove the watermark (bad for NST, good for us!).
âœ” If D(I_w) is close to 0, NST removed the watermark (good for NST, bad for us!).
